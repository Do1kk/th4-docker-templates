# Change the replication class to NetworkTopologyStrategy and set the replication factor between 3 to 5
# Every time you add or remove a datacenter, you must manually reconfigure the system_auth keyspace.

# 1. Change file cassandra.yml
authenticator: PasswordAuthenticator
authorizer: CassandraAuthorizer

# 2. Create an account and grant permissions on keyspace.
docker exec -it cass1  cqlsh -u cassandra -p cassandra
CREATE ROLE thehive WITH PASSWORD = 'thehive1234' AND LOGIN = true;
GRANT ALL PERMISSIONS ON KEYSPACE thehive TO thehive; # when you run into a problem docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d

 
# Server ssl. (node to node) (i can't configure client encryption but docker plus login and password to sqlsh is alredy secure)
# 3. Edit end execute bash file fot creating certification.
# setupkeys-cassandra-security.sh # source: https://dzone.com/articles/setting-up-a-cassandra-cluster-with-ssl

# 4. Edit cassandra.yaml for server_encryption_options # source: https://dzone.com/articles/setting-up-a-cassandra-cluster-with-ssl
server_encryption_options:
    internode_encryption: all
    keystore: /etc/cert/cassandra/cassandra.keystore # dir to file in docker
    keystore_password: cassandra
    truststore: /etc/cert/cassandra/cassandra.truststore # dir to file in docker
    truststore_password: cassandra
    # More advanced defaults below:
    protocol: TLS

# 4. Add dir of certification folder to cassandra.yaml file and docker-compose.yml

# 5. Restart docker-compose (or docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d)

# 6. Check that conection is working just fine (in some cases second and third node shudn't start because healthcehck wont pass)
# Check cassandra cluster
docker exec cass1 nodetool status

# Check cassandra claster description
docker exec cass1 nodetool describecluster

# Schema versions should represent somthing like this (when 3 nodes in [] you will find 3 IP adresses)
                xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx: [192.168.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 192.168.x.x]







(don't know is this will be helpfull)
# 1. Change the system_auth keyspace RF
ALTER KEYSPACE system_auth
    WITH REPLICATION= {'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 
                       'test_DC' : 3}; # 3 is number of nodes

# 2. Run the nodetool repair on the security keyspaces.
docker exec -it cass1 nodetool repair system_auth
